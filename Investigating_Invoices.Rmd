After having manipulated our data frame in the previous section of the site, removing rows that are not pertinent transactions and exploring missing values, duplication and limit cases, we will here start to interrogate the data, using standard data analysis techniques, with the goal to extract information that can be used for business purposes.

<br>

# - *focus of this document*

In this document we will investigate the invoices, with a focus on the phenomenon of the cancelled ones. Cancelled invoices can be very concerning as they represent lost sales so we will try to understand how widespread they are and to quantify the lost revenues.

We decided not to remove [duplicated rows](https://pykaalexandro.github.io/An-Online-Retailer-Investigation/Data_Wrangling_Part2_-missing_values_duplicated_rows-.html#-_duplicated_rows), as we prefer not to lose information about quantity even if that might inflate the number of purchases.

<br>

# - *basic breakdown*

We can begin by reminding their basic figures: how many there are and how many of them have been cancelled.

```{r}
df %>%
  summarise("Total Number of Invoices" = n_distinct(Invoice),
            "Number of Cancelled Invoices" = n_distinct(Invoice[str_starts(Invoice, "C")]),
            Percentage = formattable::percent(`Number of Cancelled Invoices` / `Total Number of Invoices`))
```

<br>

We can then continue by showing the number of invoices per day, differentiating by status.

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(Status = if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed"),
         InvoiceDay = as.Date(InvoiceDate)) %>%
  group_by(InvoiceDay, Status) %>%
  summarise("Number of Invoices per Day" = n_distinct(Invoice), .groups = "drop") %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = Status, values_from = `Number of Invoices per Day`, values_fill = 0) %>%
  relocate(Confirmed, .before = Cancelled)
library(ggplot2)
df %>%
  mutate(Status = forcats::fct_rev(if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed")),
         InvoiceDay = as.Date(InvoiceDate)) %>%
  group_by(InvoiceDay, Status) %>%
  summarise("Number of Invoices per Day" = n_distinct(Invoice), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(InvoiceDay, `Number of Invoices per Day`, linetype = Status)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL, 
       title = "Number of Invoices per Day, differentiating by Status") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.title = element_blank())
```

From the graph it seems like the cancelled invoices are staying constant while the confirmed ones are on an upward trend.

We complete this section with the distribution of the number of invoices per day, both with a table and with a graph, to show the difference in magnitude between them.

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(Status = if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed"),
         InvoiceDay = as.Date(InvoiceDate)) %>%
  group_by(InvoiceDay, Status) %>%
  summarise("Number of Invoices per Day" = n_distinct(Invoice), .groups = "drop") %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "Status", values_from = "Number of Invoices per Day", values_fill = 0) %>%
  reframe(across(where(is.numeric), ~ summary(.x))) %>%
  mutate(Statistic = c("Min." , "1st Qu.", "Median", "Mean", "3rd Qu.", "Max.")) %>%
  relocate(Statistic, Confirmed, .before = Cancelled)
df %>%
  mutate(Status = forcats::fct_rev(if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed")),
         InvoiceDay = as.Date(InvoiceDate)) %>%
  group_by(InvoiceDay, Status) %>%
  summarise("Number of Invoices per Day" = n_distinct(Invoice), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(`Number of Invoices per Day`, linetype = Status)) +
  geom_density() + 
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL, 
       title = "Probability Distributions of Invoices per Day, differentiating by Status") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.title = element_blank())
```

# - *number of distinct items*

Then we want to investigate the differences in homogeneity and we can see that cancelled invoices generally contain less distinct items.

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(Status = if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed")) %>%
  group_by(Invoice, Status) %>%
  summarise("Number of Distinct Items" = n_distinct(StockCode), .groups = "drop") %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = Status, values_from = `Number of Distinct Items`) %>%
#we didn't substitute NAs with O with `values_fill = 0` as it would incorrectly modify the summary table, adding values that don't exist 
  reframe(across(where(is.numeric), ~ summary(.x))) %>%
  slice(-n()) %>%
#to remove the last line from the summary table, the one with NAs
  mutate(Statistic = c("Min." , "1st Qu.", "Median", "Mean", "3rd Qu.", "Max.")) %>%
  relocate(Statistic, Confirmed, .before = Cancelled) 
df %>%
  mutate(Status = forcats::fct_rev(if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed"))) %>%
  group_by(Invoice, Status) %>%
  summarise("Number of Distinct Items" = n_distinct(StockCode), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Status, `Number of Distinct Items`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Distributions of the Number of Distinct Items per Invoice, differentiating by Status, \n Logarithmic Scale")
```

<br>

# - *differences in quantity*

We proceed analogously for the `Quantity` column, calculating the total quantities for each invoice, in absolute values (as cancelled invoices have negative ones).

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(Status = if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed")) %>%
  group_by(Invoice, Status) %>%
  summarise("Total Quantity" = sum(abs(Quantity)), .groups = "drop") %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "Status", values_from = "Total Quantity") %>%
#we didn't substitute NAs with O with `values_fill = 0` as it would incorrectly modify the summary table, adding values that don't exist 
  reframe(across(where(is.numeric), ~ summary(.x))) %>%
  slice(-n()) %>%
#to remove the last line from the summary table, the one with NAs
  mutate(Statistic = c("Min." , "1st Qu.", "Median", "Mean", "3rd Qu.", "Max.")) %>%
  relocate(Statistic, Confirmed, .before = Cancelled)
df %>%
  mutate(Status = forcats::fct_rev(if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed"))) %>%
  group_by(Invoice, Status) %>%
  summarise("Total Quantity" = sum(abs(Quantity)), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Status, `Total Quantity`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::label_number()) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Distributions of Quantity per Invoice, differentiating by Status, \n Logarithmic Scale")
```

And we can see that cancelled invoices are, again, generally smaller.

The same `Max`. value for both statuses piqued our interest and we found out that three invoices share it.

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(Invoice %in% c("C524235", "518505", "524174")) %>%
  count(Invoice, wt = abs(Quantity), name = "Total Quantity")
```

It is not by chance that it happened, as all three contain the same items in the same quantities and two of them are made by the same customer, very curious.

```{r}
df %>%
  filter(Invoice %in% c("C524235", "518505", "524174")) %>%
  arrange(StockCode)
```

<br>

# - *differences in revenues*

Besides being comprised of less distinct items and in smaller quantities, cancelled invoices are of smaller absolute monetary value as well.   

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(Status = if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed")) %>%
  group_by(Invoice, Status) %>%
  summarise("Total Value" = sum(abs(Quantity * Price)), .groups = "drop") %>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from = "Status", values_from = "Total Value") %>%
#we didn't substitute NAs with O with `values_fill = 0` as it would incorrectly modify the summary table, adding values that don't exist 
  reframe(across(where(is.numeric), ~ summary(.x))) %>%
  slice(-n()) %>%
#to remove the last line from the summary table, the one with NAs
  mutate(Statistic = c("Min." , "1st Qu.", "Median", "Mean", "3rd Qu.", "Max.")) %>%
  relocate(Statistic, Confirmed, .before = Cancelled)
df %>%
  mutate(Status = forcats::fct_rev(if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed"))) %>%
  group_by(Invoice, Status) %>%
  summarise("Total Value" = sum(abs(Quantity * Price)), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Status, `Total Value`)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::label_number()) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Distributions of Revenues per Invoice, differentiating by Status, \n Logarithmic Scale")
```

The total loss in revenues can be quantified to `247901.4 Â£`, `2.46%` over the hypothetical revenues those invoices had not been cancelled.

```{r}
df %>%
  summarise("Total Revenues" = sum(abs(Quantity) * Price),
            "Lost Revenues" = sum(abs(Quantity[str_starts(Invoice, "C")]) * Price[str_starts(Invoice, "C")]),
            Percentage = formattable::percent(`Lost Revenues` / `Total Revenues`))
```

<br>

# - *country breakdown*

Let's look now at the number of invoices per country, where we see that more than `9` invoices out of `10` pertain to `United Kingdom`.

```{r}
df %>%
  count(Country, wt = n_distinct(Invoice), sort = TRUE, name = "Number of Invoices") %>%
  mutate(Percentage = formattable::percent(`Number of Invoices` / sum(`Number of Invoices`)))
df %>%
  count(Country, wt = n_distinct(Invoice)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(Country, n), n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL,
       title = "Number of Invoices per Country")
```

It is more interesting to see if some countries cancel invoices more often than others,

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(Status = if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed")) %>%
  count(Country, Status, wt = n_distinct(Invoice), name = "Number of Invoices") %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  mutate(Percentage = formattable::percent(`Number of Invoices` / sum(`Number of Invoices`)),
         Arranging_Column = sum(`Number of Invoices`)) %>%
#`Arranging_Column` is used to have the Countries with the highest total number of invoices on top  
  ungroup() %>%
  arrange(desc(Arranging_Column), desc(Status)) %>%
  select(-Arranging_Column)
```

and, among the `26` countries with cancellations, we can spot `Nigeria` and `Japan` with fairly high rates, but we have to consider that these two countries don't have a elevate number of invoices (just `2` for the former and `30` for the latter).

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(Status = if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed")) %>%
  count(Country, Status, wt = n_distinct(Invoice), name = "Number of Occurrences") %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  mutate("Number of Invoices" = sum(`Number of Occurrences`),
         Percentage = formattable::percent(`Number of Occurrences` / sum(`Number of Occurrences`))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(Status == "Cancelled") %>%
  arrange(desc(Percentage)) %>%
  select(Country, `Number of Invoices`, "Number of Cancellations" = `Number of Occurrences`, Percentage)
```

This graph reflects that, as the y axis is ordered, after `NA`, by the number of invoices.

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(Status = forcats::fct_rev(if_else(str_detect(Invoice, "C"), "Cancelled", "Confirmed"))) %>%
  count(Country, Status, wt = n_distinct(Invoice)) %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  mutate(perc = formattable::percent(n / sum(n))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(Country, n), perc, fill = Status)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent()) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_grey() +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL, 
       title = "Cancellation Rates per Country") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", 
        legend.title = element_blank())
```

# - *main takeaways*

- Cancelled invoices, being `16.64%` of the total, are a not negligible phenomenon
- Their daily occurrence stayed constant during last year while confirmed ones are on a rising trend
- Compared to the confirmed ones, they are generally smaller in terms of distinct items, total quantity and revenue 
- The loss in revenue can be quantified to `247901.4 Â£`, the `2.46%`
- The market is mainly based in the `United Kingdom`, among other countries `Nigeria` and `Japan` have high cancellation rate, but are not very active customers
